## Development

Install the following dependencies to start the development of the project.

| Tool           | Description                                                | Link                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PNPM           | Node package manager to install frontend dependencies      | https://pnpm.io/installation                                                                    |
| NVM            | Node.js version manager                                    | https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating                                           |

Then you can install the node.js version of the project by running

`nvm install`

After that you need to install the `node_modules` of the project by running the following command:

`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

Then start the application by running

`pnpm dev`

**That's it happy development** ðŸŽ‰
